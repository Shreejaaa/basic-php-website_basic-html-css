    <h1>Fundamentals of CSS</h1>
    <h2>Cascading</h2>
    <p style="font-weight: 800;">Style can be added as an inline elment using the style attribute on tags as is the case for this paragraph.
         Here font-weight has been given a weight of 800.

         <p style="color: green; font-weight:100; word-spacing:3px; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif">

       &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp The inline style takes precedent over all other style <br>
       &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp declarations. Next in order of precedent is the embeded <br>
       &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp style. This uses style tags and is often found in the<br>
       &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp header section of a page. This pre tag is styled with<br>
       &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp embedded style. &nbsp An extra large green font.</p>   
       
       <p>Ideally style is held seperate to structure in a style sheet. Other than the 2 examples above all other style on this page is in a seperate style sheet. Including the change of base font to Arial.</p>

      <h2>  <p style="font-family: 'Gill Sans', sans-serif; font-weight:800; " >Selectors</p> </h2>
      <p style="font-family: 'Verdana', sans-serif;" >CSS selectors are used to apply style. There is the element selector, class selector and id selector.
       All being well you have used an element selector to modify the font on this page by adding style to 
       the body Itag in your attached style sheet. Words in this <span id="word">sentence</span> have been <span id="word">styled</span>using 
       a class selector applied to letter-spacing and the heading for this section with an id selector.</p>

       <h2>Box model</h2>
   
       <div class="box">
        <a href="https://www.tutorialrepublic.com/html-tutorial/" >https://www.tutorialrepublic.com/html-tutorial/ </a>
       </div> 
    
       <div class="box">
        <a href="https://www.tutorialrepublic.com/css-tutorial/" >https://www.tutorialrepublic.com/css-tutorial/ </a>
       </div> 

       <div class="box1">
        <a href="https://www.w3schools.com" >https://www.w3schools.com</a>
       </div>
      
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>

    The links above are held in a list that is re-styled to remove list-style-type and display inline. Padding, margin and border are then added as appropriate.

    <h2> Layout</h2>


    <div class="container">
    <div class="box2">
        These words are in column 1
    </div> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp

    <div class="box3">
        These words are in column 2
    </div> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp

    <div class="box4">
        These words are in column 3
    </div>
</div>
<br>
Margin, padding, borders and floats added to achieve this lavout of columns.
