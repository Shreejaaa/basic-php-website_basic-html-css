    <h1> Fundamentals of HTML</h1>
    <h2> Text Formatting</h2>
    <p> A paragraph with <i> some words that are emphasized</i> and <b>some important words.</b> Followed by some <mark>highlighted words</mark>.
        Feel free to add any other text formatting that appeals to you.</p>
        &nbsp   &nbsp  This is some text <br>
        &nbsp   &nbsp  that is laid out exactiv as<br>
        &nbsp   &nbsp  Laid out at code level without any additional<br>
        &nbsp   &nbsp  markup

        <h2> Special Characters</h2>
        The browser thinks < is a programming character. Also >. The browser also ignores any line breaks <br>
        in your code and any &nbsp &nbsp white space. To include these you need to use special characters aka html character entities. 
        There are other entities available such as .. and &

    <h2> Links </h2>
    A web page without any links is a unique and peculiar find. You can have links to separate
     sites such as <a href = "https://www.leedsbeckett.ac.uk"> Leeds Beckett. 

     </a> Links to other pages of the <a href = "second.html">same site.</a>
     Links to another point in the <a href = "second.html">same page.</a>

     <h2> Images</h2>
     <p align="justify"> This image is stored on this server in an image sub-folder  &nbsp &nbsp
        <img src="aaa.png" alt="gift" title="gift box" width="100px"/>  <br> <br>
        I hope you added an alt attribute to support screen readers <br> <br>

        Why not check to see what happens if you try to validate your code using the W3C Markup Validation Service without
         the alt attribute included. If you right click on your page and chose inspect or view source you can check your
          code and see the HTML comment you have added just inside the body tag
